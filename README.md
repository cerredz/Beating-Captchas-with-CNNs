Both me and nickd16 completed this project in a 24-hour hackathon hosted at TCNJ. Our project won Best Random Hack at the event. Our project uses an AI to successfully solve a captcha, and displays it on a website. Some languages/frameworks we used to build our project for the frontend/backend/ai were html, css, javascript, bootstrap, flask, jquery, python, and tenserflow. All you have to do to see the AI solving tyhe catpcha is this:

Download all the files to a folder in your pc
Once you are in that file open your terminal and navigate to the folder
type 'python app.py' in your terminal
open localhost:5000 on a chrome tab
hit the 'ai demo' button to solve the captche using the ai
Once ran, the website will automatically refresh with a new 9 images, and a new captcha to solve.
